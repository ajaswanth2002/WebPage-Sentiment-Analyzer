In the assignment on Sentiment Analysis for Black Coffer web pages, I utilized BeautifulSoup module in Python for data extraction and cleaning. After extracting all paragraph text and cleaning the data, I proceeded with sentiment analysis using the nltk and SentimentIntensityAnalyzer module.

1. Positive and Negative Scores: The SentimentIntensityAnalyzer module was employed to generate positive and negative scores from the text.
   - Positive Score: The measure of positive sentiment in the text.
   - Negative Score: The measure of negative sentiment in the text.

2. Polarity and Subjectivity Scores: Using the same module, I obtained polarity and subjectivity scores.
   - Polarity Score: Indicates the sentiment polarity of the text.
   - Subjectivity Score: Reflects the subjectivity level of the text.

3. Average Sentence Length: Calculated using the formula:
   - Average Sentence Length = Total number of words / Total number of sentences

4. Fog Index: Determined using the formula:
   - Fog Index = 0.4 * (Average Sentence Length + Percentage of Complex Words)

5. Average Number of Words Per Sentence: Computed using:
   - Average Number of Words Per Sentence = Total number of words / Total number of sentences

6. Word Count: Utilized the word_tokenize module from nltk to count words in the text.

7. Complex Word Count: Employed word_tokenize and cmudict functions from nltk to count complex words.

8. Percentage of Complex Words: Found using:
   - Percentage of Complex Words = (Complex Words / Total Words) * 100

9. Syllables per Word: Counted syllables using vowels.

10. Personal Pronouns: Counted occurrences of personal pronouns like I, we, my, ours, and us.

Finally, I presented the final output in the notebook, checking for any null values or inconsistencies.
Please note that the code is designed to run in a Colab notebook environment.
Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment. I look forward to any feedback or further instructions you may have.
Best regards,
Jaswanth
